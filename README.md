# Assignment 04, Fall 2018 - SDL and Inheritance

This assignment introduces you to inheritance and to SDL.

Here are some guidelines for the assignment.

## Assignment Etiquette
- Do not do this assignment in one sitting. It will overwhelm you.
- You need to do the assignment alone.
- It is strongly advised that you start working on the assignment the day you get it. Assignments WILL take time.
- It is better to submit the work that you have done yourself than what you have plagiarized.
- You may be called in for a viva for any assignment that you submit.

## Coding
- Follow the best programming practices as given on [`LMS -> Resources`](https://lms.habib.edu.pk/portal/site/684809f6-2cec-479c-8910-2f0b77a8793c/page/dccf5cb0-6a79-4411-ba15-ba6a63a507ea)` -> Common -> Coding Practices`. Failure in doing so will have your marks deducted. See grading rubric for details.

## Grading
- Submit code that compiles. Code that does not compile will be penalized.
- Grading is indicated in the rubric, _Assignment_Rubric.csv_.

## Submission
- Due: 1830h on 15th of October on Github.
- Note the submission deadline above. GitHub logs submission time and late submissions will not be graded.
- Submission through other means, e.g. over email, will be ignored.
### Submission - WS section
- Follow the assignment sheet and the style in the provided sample code in your GitHub repository. The style is slightly different from the file in the ZIP file on LMS. The tasks to be completed are otherwise identical.
- Make it a practice to push every working version (free of warnings, errors, and crashes) of your code right from the start, even if it doesn't yet fully solve the assignment.
### Submission - Other sections
- Every assignment you submit should be a single zipped file containing all the other files. Suppose your name is John Doe and your id is 0022 so the name of the submitted file should be JohnDoe0022.zip
- Make it a practice to submit your work, even if it is incomplete, at least 10 minutes before the deadline and then continue to submit updates.
